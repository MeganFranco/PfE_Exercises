print ("Hello %s" % name);

#exercise 2.3 -- need to use int() around raw_input() in order to get 'hours' to be an
#integer class, or else it is 'floor' because you need to set hours to a whole number (35)
#and it cannot use the multiplication operator to complete the problem
rate=2.75
hours=int(raw_input("enter hours: "))
pay=(rate *  hours)
print pay

#Exercise 2.5
celc = int(raw_input("Enter temperature in Celcius : "))
fahr = celc * 1.8 + 32
print fahr

#Exercise 2.4
width = 17
height = 12.0

print width/2
# the result is 8 because python rounds its answers down when using floor numbers
print width/2.0
# the result is 8.5 because the divisor was in integer class
print height/3
#4.0
print 1 + 2 * 5
