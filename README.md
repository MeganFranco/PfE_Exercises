# PfE_Exercises
This file contains some of the exercises from the Python for Informatics by Charles Severence: http://www.pythonlearn.com/book_007.pdf

Exercises are listed by chapter number, hopefully with the challenge/promt in a note above 

the benefit to having one of these all in one place is that as I absorb more Python knowledge through web-browsing/net-surfing(/whateverkidscallitthesedays?) is that if I find a better(/different/more efficient) way to get the same result, I don't have to wait to get back to my computer to modify the code or to link new approachs to the problems
- List Comprehension, I'm looking at you!
