So what do you have to do to factor out a number? What about numbers that can be factored different ways?
what about an empty list?

#make a function? def divide(): ? --> or just make the function that does the divising loop and run first the input number and then through the list of numbers everytime until no more... but how to stop it from being infinite?
def divide(num):

    if num%2 == 0:
        #add the result to divisors
        continue
    else: continue
    elif num%3 == 0
        #add result to the divisors
        continue
    else: continue #etc
    
#Take this list and run it through another loop?


#How can you make this loop until no more numberes other than 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 exist?
#Will have to count number of times each of these numbers (other than one?) occur
